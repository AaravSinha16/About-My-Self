            <p>My Hobby is Playing great Virtual games in my Free time. After coming back from school I play video games on my pc after completing my homework. I'm 11 years old and studying in 5th Standard. Whenever I get tired of studying I play video games on my pc, But you should not play too much of video games you should also study hard to become something in your life. To play too much video games is also harmful for you eyes if you will play too much of video games you eyes will start spoiling and in sometime you eyes will see everything blurred, So you should always wear a bluray protective glasses to stop your eyes from spoiling It protects your eyes. But always remeber to become a good person in your life you should study hard.</p>
